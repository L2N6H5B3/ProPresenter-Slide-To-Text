# SlideToText for ProPresenter 6

## SlideToText
SlideToText is a little Java-based app that I wrote to pull in the Stage Display data from ProPresenter and output the current slide to a text file for use as an overlay with OBS.


## Configuration and Use
config.txt stores all configuration information relating to the app.  Use config.txt to configure the IP/Hostname, ports, and passwords to use with SlideToText.


## Upcoming Features
While I don't plan on making any more changes to this application, I'm always open to suggestions!
